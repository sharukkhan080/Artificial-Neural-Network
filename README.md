# Artificial-Neural-Network
Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.
The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. But over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. ANNs have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games, medical diagnosis, and even in activities that have traditionally been considered as reserved to humans, like painting.

# Applications of Artificial-Neural-Network 
Because of their ability to reproduce and model nonlinear processes, Artificial neural networks have found applications in many disciplines. Application areas include system identification and control (vehicle control, trajectory prediction, process control, natural resource management), quantum chemistry, general game playing, pattern recognition (radar systems, face identification, signal classification, 3D reconstruction, object recognition and more), sequence recognition (gesture, speech, handwritten and printed text recognition), medical diagnosis, finance (e.g. automated trading systems), data mining, visualization, machine translation, social network filtering and e-mail spam filtering. ANNs have been used to diagnose cancers, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and to distinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using only cell shape information

# What problems can neural networks solve?
Today, neural networks are used for solving many business problems such as sales forecasting, customer research, data validation, and risk management. For example, at Statsbot we apply neural networks for time-series predictions, anomaly detection in data, and natural language understanding.

# What is the biggest problem with neural networks?
Overfitting/underfitting: Neural networks normally have a large enough capacity to store the whole training data, including noise. There are many ways like dropout, & regularization to work around such a problem but still, modern neural networks have a tendency to overfit.

# How do I choose a neural network?
The most common approach seems to be to start with a rough guess based on prior experience about networks used on similar problems. This could be your own experience, or second/third-hand experience you have picked up from a training course, blog or research paper.

# How deep should my neural network be?
one should never use more than two hidden layers of Neurons. According to this answer, a middle layer should contain at most twice the amount of input or output neurons (so if you have 5 input neurons and 10 output neurons, one should use (at most) 20 middle neurons per layer).
The reason behind the boost in performance from a deeper network, is that a more complex, non-linear function can be learned. Given sufficient training data, this enables the      networks to more easily discriminate between different classes
Getting a better accuracy with deep learning algorithms is either due to a better Neural Network, more computational power or huge amounts of data. ... The recent breakthroughs in the development of algorithms are mostly due to making them run much faster than before, which makes it possible to use more and more data.
